Loading the data
```{r}
data = read.csv("Speed.csv", header=TRUE)
attach(data)
```

Regression model for fatality
```{r}
model_1 = lm(FatalityRate~Year, data=data)
summary(model_1)
```

The slope of the fit is -.044870.

Examining the residual plot
```{r}
plot(model_1$residuals~model_1$fitted.values, xlab="Predicted", ylab="Residuals")
abline(h=0)
```

There appears to be some correlation in the residuals.

Fitting a multiple regression model
```{r}
model_2 = lm(FatalityRate ~ Year + StateControl + Year*StateControl)
summary(model_2)
```

Given that the StateControl predictor is significant, we can say that there is a significant change in the relationship between FatalityRate and Year after 1995.

The fitted equation is then $$ \hat Fatality = 2162 - .1076(Year)-161.4(StateControl)+.08097(Year*StateControl)$$
$$StateControl = \begin{cases}
1 & Year \geq 1995\\
0 & Year < 1995
\end{cases}$$
